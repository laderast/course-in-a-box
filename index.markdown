#R Programming Bootcamp

This self-directed course is intended to introduce the novice programmer to the basics of R programming. The emphasis of this course is on useful R programming skills including loading and manipulating data within R, and secondarily simple visualization, data QC, and statistics. The structure of this course is meant to introduce you to data structures in R such as vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames along with immediate tasks to learn how they work and how to manipulate them.

This course is self-paced. You may begin it at any time and proceed at any pace as long as you complete modules in order.  For more sophisticated programmers, each module contains a self-evaluation problem and quiz in order to assess whether you need to complete a module or not.

##Prerequisites: 
An introductory programming course and familiarity with basic programming concepts such as if/then and for/while loops and simple data structures such as arrays.
